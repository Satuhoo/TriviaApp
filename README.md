# Trivia Application

A simple Quiz game made with Vue. Uses the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) for Quiz questions.

The user can select the amount of questions and choose from a few different categories.
Using the default 'any' category the app pulls questions from all the categories available in the opentdb database.
